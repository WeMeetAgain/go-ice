gather candidates - each has component ID, increments by 1 for each stream
    - host candidates 
        - bind to port on IP address attached to interface(s)
    - Server reflexive and relayed candidates 
        - 'should' be used 
        	- https://github.com/denis-beurive/GoStun
        - 'should' use single STUN and/or TURN
        - TURN
            - allocate requests should be authed
            - try new transaction every Ta milliseconds after
            - On allocate rejection, send binding request for server reflexive only
    - each candidate is assigned fondation ID, two candidates MUST have the same ID when:
        - same type - host, relayed, server reflex, peer reflex
        - their IP addresses are the same
        - for reflexive and relayed candidates, the STUN/TURN serevers have the same IP addr
        - same transport protocol - UDP, TCP
    - candidates must be kept alive
        - additional binding requets - STUN
        - additional refresh requests - TURN
prioritize them
    - unique priotity per candidate (1- 2^31-1)
    - type preference 0-126 inclusive,
        - 0 as last resort
        - types are local, server reflex., peer, relayed
        - 126 host, 100 server reflex, 110 peer reflex, 0 relay
    - local preference 0-65535 inclusive
        - single IP set to 65535, multiple IPs set one lower
    - priority = 2^24 * type preference + 2^8 * local preference + 256 - component ID

eliminate redundant
    - redundant when transport addresses and bases equal
    - remove lowe priotiry
choose default candidates
    - one per media stream
    - recommended that the default candidates are relayed, then server reflex, then host
formulate and send SDP offer
    - m line fore each media stream
        - will perform connectivit checks on the first m line forst, most important stream first
    - candidate attribute for each candidate for a particular media stream
        - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5245#section-15
        - candidate:foundation component-id transport priority connection-address port cand-type rel-addr rel-port
    - if not RTCP must add b=RS:0 b=RR:0
